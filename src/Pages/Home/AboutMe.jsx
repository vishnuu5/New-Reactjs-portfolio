          Completing a Bachelor of Technology from JNTU Anantapur cultivated a rigorous 
          analytical mindset, fueling my passion for technology and innovation. 
          Our tenure as a Web Development Intern at Unified Mentor Private Limited was characterized
          by a robust engagement with Node.js and Bootstrap, where we developed essential web solutions
          that were both innovative and user-centric.
          Armed with certifications in full stack Developer, web Developer Intern, Baiscs of Python and MS Excel,
          our skill set has expanded to encompass both front-end and back-end development.
          The experience has not only sharpened my technical abilities but also reinforced a collaborative ethos,
          positioning us to contribute meaningfully to dynamic tech environments and future web development initiatives.
